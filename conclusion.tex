\chapter{\uppercase{Conclusions and Future Work}}

The thesis presents a scalable and distributed Seismic Data Analytics toolkit that was implemented on top of Apache Hadoop and Spark big data platforms. It is an attempt to apply HPC optimizations to big seismic data analytics applications, and simplify the parallelism efforts. The experiments and related analysis given in this thesis also showed that this toolkit provides promised scalability, by which performance enhancement can be achieved by increasing cluster hardware resources or tuning distribution parameters without refactoring the application code.

In the future, advanced data distribution strategies such as tiling and bricking with 3D overlapping will be implemented for further improvement of the application performance. More application utilities and web service will be developed for data browsing and analytics purposes. The researchers will put more efforts to provide a comprehensive Seismic Data Analytics Platform as a Service(PaaS) to facilitate the works of scientists.
