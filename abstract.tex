\indent Seismic volume is a basic data structure that has been widely used in geophysical computing and big data analytics applications of petroleum industry. It has been well studied in High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms. However, little study has been done in big data analytics platforms. In this thesis, we present the design and implementation of an efficient Distributed Seismic Data Analytics Toolkit on top of the Apache Spark big data analytics platform. The toolkit supports different ways of seismic volume data distributions, repartition, transposing, access, and data parallelism with a variety of parallel execution templates. This thesis also addresses the performance characteristics of the seismic volume data operations with different configurations, the services have been developed on top of this toolkit, as well as the current status and future research plan of the big data analytics platform. The scalability and parallelism are the main characteristics of this platform.ss
