Although various motivations exist in petroleum companies to adopt big data solutions to improve efficiency and reduce cost, only a few of them have deployed big data solutions. This situation may due to some technique barriers such as lack of technology knowledge, big data solution are not applicable in some steps of traditional workflow, and the cost and risk to convert legacy software to fit new platform etc \cite{bigdatatooil}. Moreover, there are lots of concerns of business-wise, such as the cost of infrastructure and data security issue (business or political restrictions on data accessing). 

The applications of big data analytics in the petroleum industry are still in experimental stage \cite{bigdatatooil}. Only a few companies have applied the Big Data techniques on their workflows, and most of these innovations are developed by oil and gas service contracting companies such as Schlumberger and Halliburton, as well as some IT solution providers like IBM and Microsoft  \cite{bigdatatooil}: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Chevron proof-of-concept adopted Apache Hadoop (IBM BigInsights) for seismic data processing;
  \item Shell piloting Apache Hadoop in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) for seismic sensor data;
  \item Cloudera Seismic Hadoop integrated Seismic Unix with Apache Hadoop;
  \item PointCross Seismic Data Server and Drilling Data Server utilizing Apache Hadoop / NoSQL;
  \item University of Stavanger data acquisition performance research used Apache Hadoop.
\end{enumerate}
