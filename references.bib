@article{kuck04,
	Abstract = {HPC (high performance computing) has been a popular acronym for decades,
and has been applied to many types of architectures, software and
applications. The ``P'' has recently been overloaded to mean both
performance and productivity. We present a survey of today's performance
and productivity situation relative to the constituent HPC hardware
and software components, and provide some analysis of current controversies
and open issues. Since ``HPC'' will continue to be applied to whatever
is happening at the leading edge of computer architecture, system
and development software, and algorithms and applications, there
is no hope or need to define or clean up terminology (this paper
uses HPC to denote hiperc and hiproc, with context determining meaning).
Instead, it is important to clarify the whys and wherefores of the
state of the art, in order to focus on new work that will maximize
future benefits. This paper gives a broad discussion of HPC productivity
in terms of effective architectures, run-time system software, and
applications development tools. There are costs and trade-offs associated
with each of these, and in fact multiple marketplaces consume these
products. The range of demands placed on HPC, by owners and users
of systems ranging from public research laboratories to private scientific
and engineering companies, enrich the topic with many competing technologies
and approaches. Rather than expecting to eliminate each other in
the short run, these HPC competitors should be learning from one
another in order to stay in the race. It seems clear that the dynamics
between ``commodity'' and ``custom'' building blocks will remain
at the center of HPC debates for some time, and indeed these competing
forces form the engine of improvement for overall HPC cost/effectiveness.},

@article{Moon:1997:PNC,
	Abstract = {Instruction-level parallelism (ILP) in nonnumerical code is regarded
as scarce and hard to exploit due to its irregularity. In this article,
we introduce a new code-scheduling technique for irregular ILP called
``selective scheduling'' which can be used as a component for superscalar
and VLIW compilers. Selective scheduling can compute a wide set of
independent operations across all$\backslash$/ execution paths based on renaming
and forward-substitution and can compute available operations across
loop iterations if combined with software pipelining. This scheduling
approach has better heuristics for determining the usefulness of
moving one operation versus moving another and can successfully find
useful code motions without resorting to branch profiling. The compile-time
overhead of selective scheduling is low due to its incremental computation
technique and its controlled code duplication. We parallelized the
SPEC integer benchmarks and five AIX utilities without using branch
probabilities. The experiments indicate that a fivefold speedup is
achievable on realistic resources with a reasonable overhead in compilation
time and code expansion and that a solid speedup increase is also
obtainable on machines with fewer resources. These results improve
previously known characteristics of irregular ILP.},

	Abstract = {The PAPI project has defined and implemented a crossplatform interface
to the hardware counters available on most modern microprocessors.
The interface has gained widespread use and acceptance from hardware
vendors, users, and tool developers. This paper reports on experiences
with the community-based open-source effort to define the PAPI specification
and implement it on a variety of platforms. Collaborations with tool
developers who have incorporated support for PAPI are described.
Issues related to interpretation and accuracy of hardware counter
data and to the overheads of collecting this data are discussed.
The paper concludes with implications for the design of the next
version of PAPI.},

@inproceedings{Dean2012,
	Abstract = {Recent work in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning has shown that being able to train large models can dramatically improve performance. In this paper, we consider the problem of training a deep network with billions of parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores. We have developed a software framework called DistBelief that can utilize computing clusters with thousands of machines to train large models. Within this framework, we have developed two algorithms for large-scale distributed training: (i) Downpour SGD, an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent procedure supporting a large number of model replicas, and (ii) Sandblaster, a framework that supports a variety of distributed batch optimization procedures, including a distributed implementation of L-BFGS. Downpour SGD and Sandblaster L-BFGS both increase the scale and speed of deep network training. We have successfully used our system to train a deep network 30x larger than previously reported in the literature, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, a visual object recognition task with 16 million images and 21k categories. We show that these same techniques dramatically accelerate the training of a more modestly- sized deep network for a commercial speech recognition service. Although we focus on and report performance of these methods as applied to training large neural networks, the underlying algorithms are applicable to any gradient-based machine learning algorithm.},

@article{kuck04,
	Abstract = {HPC (high performance computing) has been a popular acronym for decades,
and has been applied to many types of architectures, software and
applications. The ``P'' has recently been overloaded to mean both
performance and productivity. We present a survey of today's performance
and productivity situation relative to the constituent HPC hardware
and software components, and provide some analysis of current controversies
and open issues. Since ``HPC'' will continue to be applied to whatever
is happening at the leading edge of computer architecture, system
and development software, and algorithms and applications, there
is no hope or need to define or clean up terminology (this paper
uses HPC to denote hiperc and hiproc, with context determining meaning).
Instead, it is important to clarify the whys and wherefores of the
state of the art, in order to focus on new work that will maximize
future benefits. This paper gives a broad discussion of HPC productivity
in terms of effective architectures, run-time system software, and
applications development tools. There are costs and trade-offs associated
with each of these, and in fact multiple marketplaces consume these
products. The range of demands placed on HPC, by owners and users
of systems ranging from public research laboratories to private scientific
and engineering companies, enrich the topic with many competing technologies
and approaches. Rather than expecting to eliminate each other in
the short run, these HPC competitors should be learning from one
another in order to stay in the race. It seems clear that the dynamics
between ``commodity'' and ``custom'' building blocks will remain
at the center of HPC debates for some time, and indeed these competing
forces form the engine of improvement for overall HPC cost/effectiveness.},

	Abstract = {The performance skeleton of an application is a short running program
whose performance in any scenario reflects the performance of the
application it represents. Such a skeleton can be employed to quickly
estimate the performance of a large application under existing network
and node sharing. This paper presents and validates a framework for
automatic construction of performance skeletons of parallel applications.
The approach is based on capturing the compute and communication
behavior of an executing application, summarizing this behavior and
then generating a synthetic skeleton program based on the summarized
information. We demonstrate that automatically generated performance
skeletons take an order of magnitude less time to execute than the
application they represent, yet predict the application execution
time with reasonable accuracy. For the NAS benchmark suite, we observed
that the average error in predicting the execution time was 6$\backslash$$\backslash$\%.
This research is motivated by the problem of performance driven resource
selection in shared network and grid environments.},

	Abstract = {The PAPI project has defined and implemented a crossplatform interface
to the hardware counters available on most modern microprocessors.
The interface has gained widespread use and acceptance from hardware
vendors, users, and tool developers. This paper reports on experiences
with the community-based open-source effort to define the PAPI specification
and implement it on a variety of platforms. Collaborations with tool
developers who have incorporated support for PAPI are described.
Issues related to interpretation and accuracy of hardware counter
data and to the overheads of collecting this data are discussed.
The paper concludes with implications for the design of the next
version of PAPI.},

Atmospheric Model, must perform well on a variety of computingsystems.
Supporting diverse research interests, these computationally demanding
models must be efficient for a range of problem sizes and processor
counts. In this paper we describe the data structures and associated
infrastructure developed for the physical parameterizations that
allow the Community Atmospheric Model to be tuned for vector or non-vector
systems, to provide load balancing while minimizing communication
overhead, and to exploit the optimal mix of distributed Message Passing
Interface (MPI) processes and shared OpenMP threads.},

@article{mahinthakumar02,
	Abstract = {The hybrid MPI-OpenMP model is a natural parallel programming paradigm
for emerging parallel architectures that are based on symmetric multiprocessor
(SMP) clusters. This paper presents a hybrid implementation adapted
for an implicit finite-element code developed for groundwater transport
simulations. The original code was parallelized for distributed memory
architecturesusing MPI (Message Passing Interface) using a domain
decomposition strategy. OpenMP directives were then added to the
code (a straightforward loop-level implementation) to use multiple
threads within each MPI process. To improve the OpenMP performance,
several loop modifications were adopted. The parallel performance
results are compared for four modern parallel architectures. The
results show that for most of the cases tested, the pure MPI approach
outperforms the hybrid model. The exceptions to this observation
were mainly due to a limitation in the MPI library implementation
on one of the architectures. A general conclusion is that while the
hybrid model is a promising approach for SMP cluster architectures,
at the time of this writing, the payoff may not be justified for
converting all existing MPI codes to hybrid codes. However, improvements
in OpenMP compilers combined with potentialMPI limitations in SMP
nodes may make the hybrid approach more attractive for a broader
set of applications in the future.},

@article{mahinthakumar02,
	Abstract = {The hybrid MPI-OpenMP model is a natural parallel programming paradigm
for emerging parallel architectures that are based on symmetric multiprocessor
(SMP) clusters. This paper presents a hybrid implementation adapted
for an implicit finite-element code developed for groundwater transport
simulations. The original code was parallelized for distributed memory
architecturesusing MPI (Message Passing Interface) using a domain
decomposition strategy. OpenMP directives were then added to the
code (a straightforward loop-level implementation) to use multiple
threads within each MPI process. To improve the OpenMP performance,
several loop modifications were adopted. The parallel performance
results are compared for four modern parallel architectures. The
results show that for most of the cases tested, the pure MPI approach
outperforms the hybrid model. The exceptions to this observation
were mainly due to a limitation in the MPI library implementation
on one of the architectures. A general conclusion is that while the
hybrid model is a promising approach for SMP cluster architectures,
at the time of this writing, the payoff may not be justified for
converting all existing MPI codes to hybrid codes. However, improvements
in OpenMP compilers combined with potentialMPI limitations in SMP
nodes may make the hybrid approach more attractive for a broader
set of applications in the future.},

@article{Moon:1997:PNC,
	Abstract = {Instruction-level parallelism (ILP) in nonnumerical code is regarded
as scarce and hard to exploit due to its irregularity. In this article,
we introduce a new code-scheduling technique for irregular ILP called
``selective scheduling'' which can be used as a component for superscalar
and VLIW compilers. Selective scheduling can compute a wide set of
independent operations across all$\backslash$/ execution paths based on renaming
and forward-substitution and can compute available operations across
loop iterations if combined with software pipelining. This scheduling
approach has better heuristics for determining the usefulness of
moving one operation versus moving another and can successfully find
useful code motions without resorting to branch profiling. The compile-time
overhead of selective scheduling is low due to its incremental computation
technique and its controlled code duplication. We parallelized the
SPEC integer benchmarks and five AIX utilities without using branch
probabilities. The experiments indicate that a fivefold speedup is
achievable on realistic resources with a reasonable overhead in compilation
time and code expansion and that a solid speedup increase is also
obtainable on machines with fewer resources. These results improve
previously known characteristics of irregular ILP.},

	Abstract = {The performance skeleton of an application is a short running program
whose performance in any scenario reflects the performance of the
application it represents. Such a skeleton can be employed to quickly
estimate the performance of a large application under existing network
and node sharing. This paper presents and validates a framework for
automatic construction of performance skeletons of parallel applications.
The approach is based on capturing the compute and communication
behavior of an executing application, summarizing this behavior and
then generating a synthetic skeleton program based on the summarized
information. We demonstrate that automatically generated performance
skeletons take an order of magnitude less time to execute than the
application they represent, yet predict the application execution
time with reasonable accuracy. For the NAS benchmark suite, we observed
that the average error in predicting the execution time was 6$\backslash$$\backslash$\%.
This research is motivated by the problem of performance driven resource
selection in shared network and grid environments.},
